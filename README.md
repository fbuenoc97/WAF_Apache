# WAFs_Apache
This is a guide to install mod_security and mod_evasive modules for apache in a Centos 7 environment. The purpose of this work is to get familiar with the interpretation of the logs given by apache, the syntax of the rules, and the paranoia levels.
All the steps and description are in the given pdf. There are also several scripts in order to make easier the instalation and testing of them.
The test are really simple just to generate some logs.
All the work is done in spanish, if you want to use the instalation and testing scripts, you have to use exactly these names or change the paths on them.
Hope it helps someone!
